## Introduction: What is CAVA?

CAVA (Climate and Agriculture Risk Visualization and Assessment) is a framework and approach to the analysis and visualization of state-of-the-art climate data. [CAVA is made of a Platform (GUI)](https://fao-cava.predictia.es/auth), which is freely accessible and satisfy the needs of most standard users, and a R package (**CAVAanalytics**) which allows remote access to climate data and several functions for more advance climate data analysis. 

CAVAanalytics can be used locally (installation through GitHub), remotely (registered users can access the University of Cantabria JupyterHub with 180 Gb RAM) and through a Docker image.

## Current status

**CAVAanalytics is currently in pre-release.** You can install it locally but only few climate models are available for remote access. It would work if you have data locally available. Additionally, working examples will be made available soon in the tutorial folder.
