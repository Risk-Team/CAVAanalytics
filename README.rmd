## Introduction: What is CAVA?

CAVA (Climate and Agriculture Risk Visualization and Assessment) is a framework and approach to the analysis and visualization of state-of-the-art climate data. [CAVA is made of a Platform (GUI)](https://fao-cava.predictia.es/auth), which is freely accessible and satisfy the needs of most standard users, and a R package (**CAVAanalytics**) which allows remote access to climate data and several functions for more advance climate data analysis. 

CAVAanalytics can be used locally (installation through GitHub), remotely (registered users can access the University of Cantabria JupyterHub with 180 Gb RAM) and through a Docker image.

## CAVAanalytics

**CAVAanalytics** is a package that offers a consistent framework to load, analyse and visualize multi-model ensembles. **CAVAanalytics** provides an access point for CORDEX-CORE simulations at 25 Km resolution already interpolated plus the W5E5 and ERA5 datasets.
CAVAanalytics can be seen as a wrapper of several packages, but the main engine for loading and processing climate models is the  [climate4R framework](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R), applied with a tidyverse approach.

CAVAanalytics is being developed with climate models in mind, but it can be used for any model, like impact models (ISIMIP) if data is locally available.

## Installation

Based on how you want to use CAVAanalytics, there are three options. 

### Locally from GitHub
If you have already installed most of the climaterR packages, you can simply install CAVAanalytics from GitHub:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("Risk-Team/CAVAanalytics")
```
**If you are also new to climate4R**, install its main packages first. You can do so by 

```
install.packages("rJava")
library(devtools)
install_github(c("SantanderMetGroup/loadeR.java",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/climate4R.UDG",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/loadeR",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/transformeR",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/climate4R.indices",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR"))

```

it is possible that the installation of loadR.java fails. If so, have a look at the [loadR main page](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR) and the [wiki page](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR/wiki/Installation) to solve the issue. loadR.java depends on rJava and this installation can be troublesome.

### JupyterHub

You can request access to the University of Cantabria JupyterHub, where CAVAanalytics is already installed. This will give you access to computational resources and you would be able to perform your climate analysis using a Jupyter Notebook environment.
If you would like to access these resources, you are welcome to contact riccardo.soldan@fao.org or Hideki.Kanamaru@fao.org

### Locally through Docker

A docker image will be made available soon, containing all the required software to immediately start working with CAVAanalytics.

## Using CAVAanalytics

CAVAanalytics makes it easier to work with a large number of climate or impact model simulations (netCDF files) and perform meaningful analysis. The idea behind CAVAanalytics is to first load the data (multiple models) and then work with the output of the load_data with other **CAVAanalytics** functions.

| *CAVAanalytics steps* |

### First step: load the data (**Remote repository**)
#### Loading data: load_data function

**To load CORDEX-CORE data stored remotely**, set path.to.data to "CORDEX-CORE" and specify the domain. This will load CORDEX-CORE simulations. For example:


```{r, message=FALSE}

library(CAVAanalytics)
remote.data <- load_data(country = "Sudan", variable="tasmax", years.hist=1995:2000, years.proj=2050:2055,
              path.to.data = "CORDEX-CORE", path.to.obs="W5E5", domain="AFR-22")

```

If you have some local data available, you can also use CAVAanalytics for that. **CAVAanalytics** simplifies and standardize how to load multiple climate models/simulations or other netcdf files (e.g impact models from ISIMIP). To **load local data**, specify the path to your directories, containing, for example, several RCPs and a folder with historical runs. 


```{r, message=F}


local.data <- load_data(country = "Sudan", variable="tasmax", years.hist=1980:2000, years.proj=2050:2080,
              path.to.data = "~/Databases/CORDEX-CORE/AFR-22", path.to.obs="~/Databases/W5E5")
```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

head(local.data[[1]])


```

load_data will now create a multi-model ensemble (temporally consistent) which is stored in a data frame with list columns. At this point, all dplyr, purrr and furrr functions will work, so you can use map with mutate, etc. 
You simply need to get familiar with the output of load_data. 
          
### Second step: perform analysis

The second step is the most dynamic step of the CAVAanalytics framework. 

After loading the data, regardless of whether the files are climate models or impact models, you now have a tidy tibble with list column and you can apply all of the tidyverse functions. 

#### Projections
One of the **CAVAanalytics** functions is called **projections**. As the name gives away, this function is used to calculate indexes and other statistics on future data. It is also possible to perform bias-correction if observed data has been loaded (e.g W5E5). 
In this example we will use one of the several functions available in CAVAanalytics (at the moment, only projections an dclimate_change_signal). \n

type ?projections to better understand what analysis can be performed with this function. It returns a RasterStack

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
# operations are performed for each model separately and then an ensemble mean is made. It is possible to specify thresholds with the uppert and lowert arguments
rsts <- remote.data %>%  
  projections(bias.correction = F, season = 1:12)


# calculating number of days above 45 C
rsts_thrs <- remote.data %>% 
  projections(bias.correction = F, season = 1:12, uppert = 45, consecutive = F)

```

#### Climate_change_signal
It is also possible to look at the climate change signal (delta from historical period). Similarly to the projections function, threshold can be specified with the uppert and lowert arguments. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(magrittr)

rsts_ccs <- remote.data %>%  
  climate_change_signal(., season = 1:12)

```

### Third step: visualize results

After performing the required analysis, it is sufficient to call the plotting function to visualize the results. The results can be visualized for each simulation or as an ensemble. It is also possible to decide whether to visualize the ensemble means or standard deviation.


```{r}


rsts %>%
plotting(plot_titles = "Average tasmax", ensemble=T, stat="mean") # default is mean but it can also take SD

rsts %>%
plotting(plot_titles = "Average tasmax", ensemble=F)

rsts_ccs %>%
plotting(plot_titles = "Climate change signal", ensemble=T, stat="mean", palette = c("yellow", "orange", "red", "brown")) # default is mean but it can also take SD


```

```{r}


rsts_thrs %>%
plotting(plot_titles = "N. days", ensemble=F)


```
