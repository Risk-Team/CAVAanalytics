## Introduction

**cavaR** is a package that offers a consistent framework to load, analyse and visualize multi-model ensembles. Particularly, cavaR is being developed with climate models in mind, but it can be used for any model, like impact models. 
Additionally, **cavaR** provides an access point for CORDEX-CORE simulations at 25 Km resolution already interpolated plus the W5E5 dataset.
cavaR can be seen as a wrapper of several packages, but the main engine for loading and processing climate models is the  [climate4R framework](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R), applied with a tidyverse approach. 

## Installation

If you have already installed most of the climaterR packages, you can simply install cavaR from GitHub:


```
library(devtools)
install_github("Risk-Team/cavaR")
```
**If you are also new to climate4R**, install its main packages first. You can do so by 


```
library(devtools)
install_github(c("SantanderMetGroup/loadeR.java",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/climate4R.UDG",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/loadeR",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/transformeR",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/climate4R.indices",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR"))

```

it is possible that the installation of loadR.java fails. If so, have a look at the [loadR main page](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR) and the [wiki page](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR/wiki/Installation) to solve the issue. loadR.java depends on rJava and this installation can be troublesome.

It is also possible to install all climate4R libraries through conda/mamba. If you want to know more about why you should use conda and environments with R, have a look at [this quick tutorial](https://github.com/RSO9192/conda_R).

```
conda create --name climate4R
conda activate climate4R
```
then

```
mamba install -y -c conda-forge -c r -c defaults -c santandermetgroup r-climate4r
mamba install rhumba
```
While in your environment, open R in the terminal and type

```
rhumba::install("r-devtools")
```
At this point you can install cavaR as described above, through devtools. 

```
install.packages("usethis")
library(devtools)
install_github("Risk-Team/cavaR")
```

## A framework to work with climate data and other netCDF files

cavaR makes it easier to work with a large number of climate or impact model simulations (netCDF files) and perform meaningful analysis. The idea behind cavaR is to first load the data (multiple models) and then work with the output of the load_data with other **cavaR** functions.

### First step: load the data (**locally or from remote repository**)
#### Loading data: load_data function

**cavaR** simplifies and standardize how to load multiple climate models/simulations or other netcdf files (e.g impact models from ISIMIP). To **load local data**, specify the path to your directories, containing, for example, several RCPs and a folder with historical runs. 


```{r, message=F}
library(cavaR)

local.data <- load_data(country = "Sudan", variable="tasmax", years.hist=1980:2000, years.proj=2050:2080,
              path.to.data = "~/Databases/CORDEX-CORE/AFR-22", path.to.obs="~/Databases/W5E5")
```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

head(local.data[[1]])


```

load_data will now create a multi-model ensemble (temporally consistent) which is stored in a data frame with list columns. At this point, all dplyr, purrr and furrr functions will work, so you can use map with mutate, etc. 
You simply need to get familiar with the output of load_data. 
          

**To load CORDEX-CORE data stored remotely**, set path.to.data to "CORDEX-CORE" and specify the domain. This will load CORDEX-CORE simulations from ESGF node. For example:



```{r, message=FALSE}


remote.data <- load_data(country = "Sudan", variable="tasmax", years.hist=1995, years.proj=2050:2052,
              path.to.data = "CORDEX-CORE", path.to.obs="W5E5", domain="AFR-22")

```


### Second step: perform analysis

The second step is the most dynamic step of the cavaR framework. 

After loading the data, regardless of whether the files are climate models or impact models, you now have a tidy tibble with list column and you can apply all of the tidyverse functions. One of the **cavaR** functions is called **projections**. As the name gives away, this function is used to calculate indexes and other statistics on future data. It is also possible to perform bias-correction if observed data has been loaded (e.g W5E5). 
In this example we will use one of the several functions available in cavaR (at the moment, only projections). \n

type ?projections to better understand what analysis can be performed with this function. It returns a RasterStack

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
# operations are performed for each model separately and then an ensemble mean is made
rsts <- remote.data %>%  
  projections(bias.correction = F, season = 1:12)


# calculating number of days above 45 C
rsts_thrs <- remote.data %>% 
  projections(bias.correction = F, season = 1:12, uppert = 45, consecutive = F)

```

### Third step: visualize results

After performing the required analysis, it is sufficient to call the plotting function to visualize the results. The results can be visualized for each simulation or as an ensemble. 


```{r}


rsts %>%
plotting(plot_titles = "Average tasmax", ensemble=T)

rsts %>%
plotting(plot_titles = "Average tasmax", ensemble=F)



```

```{r}


rsts_thrs %>%
plotting(plot_titles = "N. days", ensemble=F)


```
