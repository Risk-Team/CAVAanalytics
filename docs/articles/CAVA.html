<p>CAVAanalytics is part of a broader framework, called CAVA (Climate
and Agriculture Risk Visualization and Assessment) designed to
democratize the accessibility and visualization of climate data for
agricultural climate services. CAVA is developed jointly by <strong>The
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the
University of Cantabria, Predictia and the University of Cape
Town</strong>. The university of Cantabria and Predictia are also the
developers of the <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-interactive-climate-atlas-game-changer-policymakers#:~:text=The%20new%20Copernicus%20Interactive%20Climate,future%20climate%20change%20information%20using" class="external-link">Copernicus
Climate Atlas</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cavas-relationship-with-the-copernicus-climate-atlas-and-the-ipcc-atlas">CAVA’s Relationship with the COPERNICUS Climate Atlas and the IPCC
Atlas<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cavas-relationship-with-the-copernicus-climate-atlas-and-the-ipcc-atlas"></a>
</h2>
<p>The new COPERNICUS Climate Atlas was developed by The University of
Cantabria and Predictia and built from the IPCC Interactive Atlas. These
two tools are excellent web applications that allow users to quickly and
reliably visualize past and future climate change information for broad
geographical areas.</p>
<p>CAVA positions itself as a specialized tool which conveys climate
information at country level and also delivers climate change
information for a specific sector, agriculture. For example, this is
made possible through the visualization of specific agroclimatic
indicators or the possibility of downloading daily data that can be used
for crop model forcing. CAVA also uses some of the climate data sources
also used by the COPERNICUS Climate Atlas.</p>

</h2>
<p>The democratization of climate data has historically oscillated
between two primary modalities: the visualization of climate model
outputs for general understanding (illustrated by tools like the IPCC
Interactive Atlas) and the provision of direct access to raw climate
data for in-depth analysis (exemplified by data access points like
ESGF). This bifurcation has traditionally catered to either novice or
expert users, leaving a gap for those in-between.</p>
<p>CAVA emerges as a comprehensive solution designed to bridge this
divide, catering to a broader audience that includes both standard
users, who prefer graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for their simplicity,
and intermediate users, who possess some programming acumen and require
more direct access to climate data for advanced analysis.</p>
<p>The CAVA ecosystem is bifurcated into two distinct components to
accommodate this diverse user base. The first component is a <a href="https://fao-cava.predictia.es/" class="external-link"><strong>Platform GUI</strong></a>,
which is freely accessible and specifically designed to meet the needs
of standard users. This platform focuses on climate and its impact on
agriculture, presenting data in a user-friendly manner that does not
compromise on depth or relevance.</p>
<p>The second component is an R package, <a href="https://risk-team.github.io/CAVAanalytics/"><strong>CAVAanalytics</strong></a>,
tailored for those who seek a more hands-on approach to climate data.
This package provides direct access to climate model outputs, enabling
users to easily work with and calculate climatic indicators across
multi-model ensembles.</p>
<p>By offering these complementary tools, CAVA represents a holistic
approach to engaging with climate data, ensuring that users across the
spectrum, from those seeking simplicity and ease of use to those
requiring depth and flexibility for complex analyses, are
well-served.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="framework.png" alt="*CAVA can be used through a graphic user interface (CAVA Platform) or through the CAVAanalytics R package. The package can be used locally (GitHub installation), remotely (University of Cantabria JupyterHub), or locally but through a Docker image to solve dependencies issues.

<p>CAVA is strategically structured around <strong>two primary
modules</strong> to provide users with in-depth insights into climate
and agricultural impacts. This bifurcation facilitates targeted analysis
and data exploration, catering to the specific needs of the user
base.</p>
<p><strong>Climate module</strong>: Provision of climate information
from regional climate model outputs (CORDEX-CORE and reanalyses
datasets)</p>
<p><strong>Agriculture module</strong>: Provision of impact information
from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project
(ISIMIP3)</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="climate-module">Climate module<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#climate-module"></a>
</h3>
<p>CAVA makes use of outputs from Regional Climate Models. These models
are used to downscale Global Climate Models at higher spatial
resolution. The project in charge of providing Regional Climate Models
is called CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment).
The outputs of these models are available for specific geographical
areas around the world, called domains. More information about the data
behind CAVA can be found <a href="https://risk-team.github.io/CAVAanalytics/articles/Introduction.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="domains.png" id="fig:figure-2"></p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="agriculture-module">Agriculture module<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#agriculture-module"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Agriculture Module is under development with the aim of providing
streamlined visualization and access to agricultural impact model
outputs, courtesy of the <a href="https://www.isimip.org/about/" class="external-link">Inter-Sectoral Impact Model
Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3)</a>.</p>
<p>Through these two meticulously designed modules, CAVA embarks on a
mission to offer comprehensive and accessible climate and agricultural
impact data. By segregating the platform into distinct but complementary
components, CAVA ensures that users can navigate and utilize the wealth
of information with ease, enabling informed decision-making and research
in the realms of climate science and agricultural planning.</p>
