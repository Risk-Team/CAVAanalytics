### 🚀 New Feature Alert: Pre-computed Bias-Corrected Datasets 🚀

**Bias-corrected CORDEX-CORE simulations (ISIMIP methodology) are now
available as ready-to-use, pre-computed datasets!**  
✅ **No local bias-correction step required.**  
🌍 Currently available for the **AFR-22** and **WAS-22** domains.  
🔜 Additional domains to be released soon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**CAVAanalytics**](https://risk-team.github.io/CAVAanalytics/) is a
comprehensive R package designed to simplify and enhance climate data
analysis. It offers a unified framework that streamlines access to
datasets such as W5E5, ERA5, and CORDEX-CORE models, facilitating
efficient loading, analysis, indicator calculation, and visualization of
climate and impact model data

### Key Features:

- **Simplified Data Access:** Retrieve CORDEX-CORE models globally
  without the need to manage netCDF files. Data requests are sent to
  THREDDS servers, allowing you to access only the necessary information
  directly in memory.
- **Consistent Analytical Framework:** Work seamlessly with multiple
  climate models, making indicator calculation and result visualization
  straightforward and efficient.
- **Pre-computed bias-corrected datasets:** Directly access
  ISIMIP-style, bias-corrected CORDEX-CORE simulations as pre-computed
  products, currently available for the AFR-22 and WAS-22 domains (with
  more domains to be added), ideal for users who want bias-corrected
  data without running the correction workflow themselves.

### Pre-computed bias-corrected datasets

The pre-computed bias-corrected CORDEX-CORE simulations available in
CAVAanalytics have been bias-corrected using ERA5 as the reference
dataset, following the ISIMIP methodology. These ready-to-use datasets
eliminate the need for users to perform local bias-correction
procedures, providing immediate access to high-quality, bias-adjusted
climate projections.

### Quick example

Below is an example of how to use CAVAanalytics to retrieve and analyze
climate information for Sudan, covering both historical and projected
data. Detailed examples are available from the [tutorial
webpage](https://risk-team.github.io/CAVAanalytics/articles/Introduction.html).

This script retrieves precipitation data for Sudan from 1990 to 2000
(historical) and 2020 to 2030 (projected), analyzes the climate change
signal, and visualizes the projected change in total annual
precipitation compared to the 1990-2000 baseline period.

``` r

library(CAVAanalytics)
# 1st step
 remote.data <- load_data(country = "Sudan", variable="pr",
 years.hist=1990:2000, years.proj=2020:2030,
 path.to.data = "CORDEX-CORE-BC", aggr.m="sum", domain="AFR-22")
# 2nd step
sudan_ccs <- climate_change_signal(remote.data, season=list(1:12), bias.correction = F)
# 3rd step
 plotting(sudan_ccs, ensemble=FALSE, plot_titles = "Precipitation change (mm)",
 palette=IPCC_palette(type = "pr", divergent = T), legend_range = c(-400,400))
```

### Installation options

Depending on your preferences and setup, CAVAanalytics can be installed
in the following ways:

#### 1) Locally

**If you are new to climate4R**, You need to first install **rJava**.
This installation can be problematic. Follow the instructions below

**Windows**

[Installing rJava in
Windows](https://cimentadaj.github.io/blog/2018-05-25-installing-rjava-on-windows-10/installing-rjava-on-windows-10/)

**Linux and macOS**

[Installing rJava in Linux and
macOS](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR/wiki/Installation)

If the installation of rJava is successful, you should be able to load
the library from Rstudio and you can now installed CAVAanalytics.

    # Step 1: Ensure rJava is installed and working
    if (!requireNamespace("rJava", quietly = TRUE)) {
      install.packages("rJava")
    }
    library(rJava)  # Verify no errors here

    # Step 2: Install pak (if not already installed)
    if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) {
      install.packages("pak")
    }

    # Step 3: Install CAVAanalytics
    pak::pkg_install( "Risk-Team/CAVAanalytics")

#### 2) Docker

The Docker image is available at Docker.io, rso9192/cava. This docker
image is built on top of
[rocker/rstudio](https://davetang.org/muse/2021/04/24/running-rstudio-server-with-docker/)

##### Linux

Open the terminal

    # if not already installed
    sudo apt-get install snapd
    # if not already installed
    sudo snap install docker

    sudo docker pull docker.io/rso9192/cava:version3.3.2

    sudo docker run --rm \
               -p 8888:8787 \
               -e PASSWORD=password \
               -v /path/to/local/directory:/home \
               rso9192/cava:version3.3.2

Replace **/path/to/local/directory** with the local directory on your
host machine where you want to save your plots or data. For example, you
can create a folder on your Desktop called CAVA_results. Then, you would
run the above command as:

    sudo docker run --rm \
               -p 8888:8787 \
               -e PASSWORD=password \
               -v /home/Desktop/CAVA_results:/home \
               rso9192/cava:version3.3.2

Now open your favorite browser and type **<http://localhost:8888/>**.
You should see a login page: enter the **username “rstudio”** and
**password “password”** to login and that’s it! You can now use
CAVAanalytics through Rstudio server.

##### Windows

If you are using Windows, you can install [Docker
Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
first. Note that Docker Desktop would require the installation of WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux). To do that, open a Command Prompt (as
administrator) and run

    wsl --install

This will instal the Windows Subsystem for Linux in your computer. Then
**start the Docker app** and open an ubuntu terminal and run

    sudo docker pull docker.io/rso9192/cava:version3.3.2
    # ignore the messages about login

Now run your image as below. Remember to replace
**/path/to/local/directory** with the local directory on your host
machine where you want to save your plots or data. For example, you can
create a folder on your Desktop called CAVA_results. Then, you could run
the above command as:

    sudo docker run --rm \
               -p 8888:8787 \
               -e PASSWORD=password \
               -v /mnt/c/Users/my_username/Desktop/CAVA_results:/home \
               rso9192/cava:version3.3.2

Now open your favorite browser and type **<http://localhost:8888/>**.
You should see a login page: enter the **username “rstudio”** and
**password “password”** to login and that’s it! You can now use
CAVAanalytics through Rstudio server.

##### Mac

If you are using a Mac, you first need to install [Docker desktop for
Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

Then open a terminal and while Docker Desktop is open, run:

    sudo docker pull docker.io/rso9192/cava:version3.3.2

At this point, you can run the Docker image with the below comand.

    sudo docker run --rm \
               -p 8888:8787 \
               -e PASSWORD=password \
               -v /path/to/local/directory:/home \
               rso9192/cava:version3.3.2

Remember to replace **/path/to/local/directory** with the local
directory on your host machine where you want to save your plots or
data. Now open your favorite browser and type
**<http://localhost:8888/>**. You should see a login page: enter the
**username “rstudio”** and **password “password”** to login and that’s
it! You can now use CAVAanalytics through Rstudio server.

### Python

**Firstly, why Python?**

While CAVAanalytics was developed using R packages like `climate4R` and
`tidyverse` to prioritize result visualization, R lacks the
computational efficiency of Python, particularly for handling large
climate datasets. Python supports out-of-memory parallel computation for
arrays through the integration of`xarray` and `dask`, a feature absent
in R. Consequently, CAVAanalytics relies heavily on in-memory (RAM)
processing, which limits its ability to efficiently analyze large-scale
geographical areas, such as entire CORDEX domains. This limitation
arises because such analyses demand substantial RAM resources. However,
CAVAanalytics was primarily designed for country-level assessments
rather than extensive climate data analyses. ([check out the
memory-efficient functions available from CAVAanalytics
though](https://risk-team.github.io/CAVAanalytics/reference/index.html))

For users interested in accessing gridded climate projections more
efficiently, [cavapy](https://github.com/Risk-Team/cavapy) is
recommended. Cavapy focuses on data retrieval in Python, whereas
CAVAanalytics offers a broader suite of tools for processing and
visualization.
