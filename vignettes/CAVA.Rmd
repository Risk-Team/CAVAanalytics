CAVAanalytics is part of a broader framework, called CAVA (Climate and Agriculture Risk Visualization and Assessment) that aims at democratising access and processing of climate information for climate services. CAVA is developed jointly by **The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the University of Cantabria, Predictia and the University of Cape Town**.

Traditionally, the approach to climate science consisted of providing means for visualizing climate model outputs and information (e.g IPCC Interactive Atlas) or access points to the raw data (ESGF, Copernicus). These two approaches mainly serve basic users (the former) or advanced users (the latter). 

CAVA aims at serving both standard users (users who need a GUI) and intermediate users (users with some programming skills who needs easy access to climate data and downstream analyses).

Therefore, [CAVA is made of a Platform
(GUI)](https://fao-cava.predictia.es/), which is freely accessible
and satisfy the needs of most standard users interested in climate (and climate change impacts in agriculture) and an R package
([**CAVAanalytics**](https://risk-team.github.io/CAVAanalytics/)), which empowers users with direct access to high-resolution climate model outputs and means for easily working and calculating climatic indicators on multi-model ensembles. 

![CAVA can be used through a graphic user interface (CAVA Platform) or through the CAVAanalytics R package. The package can be used locally (GitHub installation), remotely (University of Cantabria JupyterHub), or locally but through a Docker image to solve dependencies issues. CAVA Platform offers three types of automatic reports, namely climate, custom climate indexes, and agriculture. The climate and agroclimatic reports are produced with CAVAanalytics.](framework.png){#fig:figure-1}



Conceptually, CAVA is organised into **two modules**. 

**Climate module**: Provision of climate information from regional climate model outputs (CORDEX-CORE and reanalyses datasets)

**Agriculture module**: Provision of impact information from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3) 

### Climate module
CAVA makes use of outputs from Regional Climate Models. These models are used to downscale Global Climate Models at higher spatial resolution. The project in charge of providing Regional Climate Models is called CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment). The outputs of these models are available for specific geographical areas around the world, called domains. More information about the data behind CAVA can be found [here](https://risk-team.github.io/CAVAanalytics/articles/Introduction.html).

### Agriculture module
CAVA is plannng to provide visualziation and streamline access to the impact model outputs of [ISIMIP](https://www.isimip.org/about/). This module is currently under development
